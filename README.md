## Installation

In order to install this project, you must first have node.js installed. Once this is installed, the project files can be obtained by forking the repository at my [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ntch2000/readme-generator).

Once the repository is cloned, the following command must be run in order to obtain the Inquirer dependency modules from npm.

```node.js
npm install
```

## Application Screenshot

## Usage

Once the project files are clones and the dependency files installed from npm, users can run the application from their working directory in the terminal by running the following command.

```node.js
node index.js
```

This will start the application with prompts the user must answer. The responses to these questions will fill the content of each heading and a README file will be generated at the conclusion of the prompts.

## Credits

Utilized license badges from [lukas-h/license-badges.md](https://gist.github.com/lukas-h/2a5d00690736b4c3a7ba). These badges allow for users to click the badge to open a page to the detailed license information that is also located in the 'License' section of the generated README

Utilized NPM Inquirer which can be found at [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). Inquirer allows for prompts to be displayed to the command line and responses to be output as an object in JavaScript.
